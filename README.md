Problem: Fluctuations in market prices leading to income uncertainty.

crops for risk mitigation.

Solution: Invest in quality control measures, adopt best practices, and seek certifications. Collaborate with agricultural extension services.

4. Logistical Challenges:

Problem: Poor transportation and storage facilities causing post-harvest losses.

Solution: Advocate for infrastructure improvements, explore cooperative storage solutions, and optimize transportation logistics.

5. Access to Information:

Problem: Lack of information about market trends, demand, and pricing.

Solution: Use technology for market information dissemination, encourage farmer cooperatives for information sharing, and support training programs.

6. Dependency on Intermediaries:

Problem: Reliance on exploitative middlemen impacting profits.

Solution: Promote direct marketing, establish farmer-producer cooperatives, and advocate for fair trade practices.

7. Payment Delays:

Problem: Delayed payments affecting cash flow.

Solution: Set clear payment terms, work with reputable buyers, and advocate for fair trade practices. Financial literacy programs can empower farmers.

8. Climate Change Impact:
